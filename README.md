👋 Hi there! I'm Yulia Shamshieva (@Yulia-Shamshieva) — an engineer by education, a developer by passion, and a creator at heart.

📱 I'm a mobile app developer specializing in Android. I love bringing ideas to life through intuitive, functional, and beautifully designed apps. Kotlin is my go-to language for Android development, and I also have solid experience with C++, Python, and several other languages.

🎨 I’m also passionate about 3D modeling, UI/UX design, and data analytics. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and creativity, where logic meets imagination.

🌟 I'm a versatile and curious person, always eager to learn something new or take on an exciting challenge. 

🐶 And here’s a fun fact: I have the cutest dog named Tatosha, who always manages to brighten my day (and sometimes interrupts my coding sessions 😄).
